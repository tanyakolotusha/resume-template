resume_header_intro: "<p>I am about to graduate from Charles University, Prague. My main focus during studies was contemporary art in Ukraine, which was reflected in my Master thesis “Art during revolution in Ukraine 2013- 2014”. Thought my interests are not limited to art. I have always been passionate about journalism and writing. Recently I have developed great interest in marketing, social media and business ownership. I am looking forward to working in a company where people are truly passionate about their job.</p>"
